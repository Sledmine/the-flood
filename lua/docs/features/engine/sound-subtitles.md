# Sound subtitles

Displays subtitles for the dialog sounds in the game. This feature takes advantage of the unused
`subtitle data` field in the sound tags to store the subtitles. The subtitles are displayed at the 
bottom of the screen when the sound is played as in any modern game.

At the moment there is no way to include the subtitles in the sound tags.
