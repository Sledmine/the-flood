# Overview

While Balltze purpose is to be a modding platform for Halo Custom Edition that makes it easy to create new
mods, it also comes with a set of features that are meant to enhance the game experience, fix bugs or even
add new functionalities to the game.

Most of the features are enabled by default, but most of them can be disabled by changing the configuration
file or using the in-game console commands to configure them. Settings file is located at `My Games/Halo CE/balltze/settings.json`, it is just a JSON file that can be edited with any text editor.

The majority of the features were implemented by a request from ShadowMods community members, so if you have
any ideas or suggestions for new features, feel free to share them in the  [Discord server](https://discord.shadowmods.net/) or in the GitHub repository. :smiley:
