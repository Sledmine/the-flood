# Widget custom aspect ratio

!!! note
    This feature is intended for developers, as it is only accessible through the plugins API.

Allows to set a custom aspect ratio for the UI. This feature can be useful to develop UIs for 
custom resolutions or aspect ratios like [Insurrection](https://github.com/Sledmine/insurrection/),
which uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.
