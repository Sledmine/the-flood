The Flood: Feet First Into Hell is a mod for Halo: Custom Edition developed by the Keymind Dev Team, featuring an all-new campaign and a vast catalog of multiplayer maps.

The story follows the perspective of the human soldiers barricaded at Installation 04 during the events of the Battle for Alpha Halo, and their constant struggle to survive the insatiable assault of the Covenant and later the Flood; It mixes elements of strategy and terror with the already classic Halo formula that have made this franchise legendary since more than two decades.

The multiplayer section is comprised of original maps and remakes of aclaimed classics, and a rich sandbox built on the foundations of previous Halo titles.
